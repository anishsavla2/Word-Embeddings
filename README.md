Basic Text vectorization and Embedding Techniquies

Disadvantage of BoW -
Feature values are either 1 or 0 hence it is not possible to determine which word is more important over another words. This is very important in solving problems like sentiment analysis.

This can be solvedd by TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

For Huge dataset - Word2Vec is a better option
